**Stockfish**: ChessBro uses the [Stockfish](https://stockfishchess.org/) chess engine for move analysis and evaluation. Stockfish is an open-source chess engine, and its performance is widely recognized as one of the best in the world. Thank you to the Stockfish team for their incredible work!

### Why'd ya make this?

**ChessBro** is one of my many personal projects where I aim to merge my love for chess and coding. Currently, game review is offered my chess.com, but it is locked behind paywall with a free limit of 1 per day. Day by day, chess.com increases pricing, adds more ADs and other _big evil corp_ stuff. I try to provide people with a free alt to game review, without emptying their bank account.

Thank you for visiting and supporting my work!
